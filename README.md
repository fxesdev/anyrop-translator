# AnyRop-Translator v0.20
translate any rop! so long as it has the gadgets lol!

__this tool is very buggy!__
--see gwetm translator if this one does not work, still in dev stages.

So the usage you say...
you run `main.py <disasembly of 1 calc you want to translate from> <the disas of the calc you want to translate to> <the rop>`

for the rop file, you have to have it in normal syntax.

don't do this
r0 = 1

do this
__mov r0, 1__

(or this)
__xxxxx__

__CHANGELOG__
